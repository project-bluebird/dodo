# Dodo specification

# Overview

Dodo is a scaffold for air traffic control (ATC) agents implemented in Python and R (PyDodo and rdodo respectively). It provides a set of commands for communicating with [BlueBird](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bluebird), an API for communicating with ATC simulators (e.g, [BlueSky](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/bluesky)).

A shared `config.yml` file exists for both rdodo and PyDodo, specifying common required parameters, settings and test cases.

# Commands

## Load scenario

**Function name:** `load_scenario`

**Parameters:**
- `scenario`: A string indicating name of scenario file on the simulator host (`<scenario>.scn`).
- `multiplier`: An optional double. Simulation rate multiplier.

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Load a scenario file and begin the simulation.

## Create scenario

**Function name:** `create_scenario`

**Parameters:** 
- `filename`: A string indicating path to scenario file on the local machine.
- `scenario`: A string indicating name to store scenario under on the simulator host (`<scenario>.scn`).

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Create scenario file on the simulator host. Once created, scenario can be loaded and started using the above `load_scenario` function. Any existing scenario with the same name will be overwritten.

## Reset the simulation

**Function name:** `reset_simulation`

**Parameters:** None

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Reset simulation to the start of the currently running scenario.

## Pause the simulation

**Function name:** `pause_simulation`

**Parameters:** None

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Pause the simulation.

## Resume the simulation

**Function name:** `resume_simulation`

**Parameters:** None

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Resume the simulation after a pause.

## Set the simulation rate multiplier

**Function name:** `set_simulation_rate_multiplier`

**Parameters:**
- `multiplier`: A positive double.

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Sets the simulation rate multiplier for the current simulation. By default this multiplier is equal to one (real-time operation). If set to another value, the simulation will run faster (or slower) than real-time, with a fixed multiplier as provided. For example, a multiplier of 2 would cause the simulation to run twice as fast: 60 simulation minutes take 30 actual minutes.

## Simulation step

**Return value:** `TRUE` if successful. Otherwise an exception is thrown.

**Description:** Step forward through the simulation. Step size is based on the [simulation rate multiplier](#set-the-simulation-rate-multiplier). Can only be used if simulator is in [agent mode](#set-simulator-mode). 

## Set simulator mode
