#' Get aircraft position
#'
#' Get the position of a single or multiple aircraft based on their IDs, or
#' positions of all aircraft in the simulation.
#'
#' @param aircraft_id
#' (Optional) Single aircraft ID, or a vector of aircraft IDs. If no ID is
#' supplied, returns positions of all aircraft in the simulation. Each aircraft
#' ID is a string.
#'
#' @return
#' A list of aircraft positions as a data frame with one row per aircraft. The
#' row names are aircraft IDs. If any of the given aircraft IDs does not exist
#' in the simulation, the returned dataframe contains a row of missing (NA)
#' values for that ID. If \code{aircraft_id} is NULL (or omitted) and no
#' aircraft exist in the simulation, an empty data frame is returned.
